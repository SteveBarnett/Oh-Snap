# Oh, Snap!

This is an exercise in logical thinking that uses some of the ideas that you learned in the [Codecademy JavaScript courses](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript).

You'll need:

* a pack of cards;
* some pens, paper, and sticky notes.

## Snap Attack

![](./img/1.jpg)

Write two sticky notes: a 1 and a 2. We'll use as labels for the two stacks of cards.

Take cards from the deck and place them under 1, then under 2, and so on.

Stop placing cards once you have a matching pair (Snap!).

### Coding without coding

Now grab the pen and paper. Write down instructions for how to play this game.

Think about how to tell the player when to keep going and when to stop.

## You've Got The Power

Add a new sticky note: 3. Pick up all the cards, and shuffle them.

Take cards from the deck and place them under 1, then under 2, then under 3, and so on.

### Coding without coding

Now update your instructions to allow for the third stack.

## It's gettin' kinda hectic

Now add another row: you should six stacks in total.

Stop when you have a match in a row, or a match in a column.

### Coding without coding

Now update your instructions to take account of the new row.

Then relax by [watching a really old video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BRv9wGf5pk).
